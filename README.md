## ðŸŽ­ Guest Mode (No Auth, No Persistence)

For quick demos or testing without authentication setup, you can run the app in Guest Mode:

```bash
AUTH_DISABLED=true pnpm dev
```

**Guest Mode Behavior:**
- âœ… Chat interface loads immediately without login
- âœ… Sign In/Sign Up buttons visible in header
- âœ… No database persistence (messages are temporary)
- âœ… Admin routes still protected (redirect to sign-in)
- âœ… No environment variables required for basic functionality

**Required Environment Variables for Guest Mode:**
```bash
AUTH_DISABLED=true
NODE_ENV=development
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Note:** Guest Mode is intended for demos and testing. For production use, configure proper authentication and database connections.
